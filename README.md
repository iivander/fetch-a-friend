## 🛢️ Using PostgreSQL as the Database

This project uses PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon) as the database backend. It stores user favorites and dog breed information.
###  Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:
- Favorite Table
```sh
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorite (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    dog_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔐 Protected Routes
```
• Users must be logged in to access certain pages.
• If a user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page.
```

## 🔄 Follow-Up Work

### Future improvements planned for the project:
```
• Expanding Test Coverage – Improve test suite coverage for better reliability.
• Filter by Location/Zip Code – Allow users to filter dog breeds by location.
• Refine Pagination UX – Keep pagination layout consistent and handle edge cases.
• Implement Token Refreshing – Add functionality to refresh authentication tokens.
• Better error handling from server (global snackbar notifying user of any errors)
• Adding a Favorite page where user can see all the Dogs that they have favorited.
• Improved “Generate a Match” functionality and button placement. (Due to time constraints, the button was temporarily positioned at the top of the page.)
